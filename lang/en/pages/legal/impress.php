                    <strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br><br>
                    <strong>Liability for Content</strong><br><br>
                    The content of our pages has been created with the greatest care. 
                    However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. 
                    As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to general laws in accordance with § 7 Abs.1 DDG. 
                    According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored foreign information or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity. 
                    Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. 
                    Liability in this regard is only possible from the moment we become aware of a specific legal infringement. 
                    If we become aware of such legal infringements, we will remove this content immediately.<br><br>
                    <strong>Liability for Links</strong><br><br>
                    Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, over whose content we have no influence. 
                    Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. 
                    The content of the linked pages is always the responsibility of the respective provider or operator of the pages. 
                    The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. 
                    A permanent content control of the linked pages is, however, unreasonable without concrete evidence of a legal infringement. 
                    If we become aware of legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.<br><br>
                    <strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
                    The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. 
                    The duplication, editing, distribution, and any form of exploitation beyond the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. 
                    Downloads and copies of this page are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. 
                    Insofar as the contents on this page were not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are observed. 
                    In particular, third-party contents are marked as such. If you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, we ask for a corresponding notice. 
                    If we become aware of legal infringements, we will remove such contents immediately.<br><br>
                    <strong>Data Protection</strong><br><br>
                    The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal data. 
                    Insofar as personal data (for example, name, address, or email addresses) are collected on our pages, this is always done, as far as possible, on a voluntary basis. 
                    These data will not be disclosed to third parties without your explicit consent. <br>
                    We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email) may have security gaps. 
                    A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible. <br>
                    The use of contact data published in the context of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly opposed. 
                    The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, for example, through spam emails.<br>
